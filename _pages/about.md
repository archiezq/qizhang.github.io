I am currently a first-year graduate student in [Computational Science](https://www.uva.nl/shared-content/programmas/en/masters/computational-science/computational-science.html), [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/). I completed my undergraduate degree in Energy and Power Engineering (Energy Storage Track), at [North China Electric Power University](https://www.ncepu.edu.cn/). My research interests include computational energy, sustainable energy, and energy storage technologies. Besides that, I like football, rock music and climbing.
