I am a second-year graduate student in [Computational Science](https://www.uva.nl/shared-content/programmas/en/masters/computational-science/computational-science.html), [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/). 

Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant at [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.cas.cn/) under the supervision of Associate Prof. Wei Zheng. I received my B.Eng. degree in Energy Science from North China Electric Power University, where I worked with Prof. Xing Ju on thermal management of Li-ion battery.

I'm generally interested in leveraging computational methods to address critical challenges in sustainable energy. 
<!-- I completed my undergraduate degree in Energy and Power Engineering (Energy Storage Track), at [North China Electric Power University](https://www.ncepu.edu.cn/). -->

To be specific, I'm currently exploring topics like:
- Computational Energy, 
- Energy System Optimization, 
- AI for Energy and Sustainability
