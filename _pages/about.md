I am a second-year graduate student in [Computational Science](https://www.uva.nl/shared-content/programmas/en/masters/computational-science/computational-science.html), [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/).

Currently, I am working on my master's thesis *Systems Dynamics Models of Blood Pressure Regulation*, under the guidance of Prof. A.G.Hoekstra and Prof. Krzhizhanovskaya. This study aims to carry out an in-depth exploration of these regulatory feedback mechanisms. By incorporating clinical data from the Amsterdam University Medical Centers, we intend to con-
struct a more complex systemic blood flow model. Lastly, the goal is to develop a predictive tool that can accurately evaluate the risk of orthostatic hypertension in older adults.

Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant at [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.cas.cn/) under the supervision of Associate Prof. Wei Zheng from June to August 2025. I received my B.Eng. degree in Energy Science from North China Electric Power University, where I worked with Prof. Xing Ju on thermal management of Li-ion battery.

I'm generally interested in leveraging computational methods to address critical challenges in sustainable energy. 
<!-- I completed my undergraduate degree in Energy and Power Engineering (Energy Storage Track), at [North China Electric Power University](https://www.ncepu.edu.cn/). -->

To be specific, I'm currently exploring topics like:
- Computational Energy, 
- Energy System Optimization, 
- AI for Energy and Sustainability
