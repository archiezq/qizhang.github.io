I'm a first year graduate student from [Computational Science](https://www.uva.nl/shared-content/programmas/en/masters/computational-science/computational-science.html), [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/). I finished my bachelor degree in Energy and Power Engineering (Energy Storage Track), at [North China Electric Power University](https://www.ncepu.edu.cn/).  My research interest includes computational energy, sustainable energy and energy storage. Besides that, I like bouldering and climbing
