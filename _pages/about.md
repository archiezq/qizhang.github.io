I am a second-year graduate student in [Computational Science](https://www.uva.nl/shared-content/programmas/en/masters/computational-science/computational-science.html), [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/).

Currently, I am working on my master's thesis *Systems Dynamics Models of Blood Pressure Regulation*, under the guidance of Prof. A.G.Hoekstra and Prof. Krzhizhanovskaya. This study aims to explore how the baroreflex and cerebral autoregulation mechanisms effect the pressure. We developed a lumped model to simulate the system, and applied evolutionary algorithms to optimise the input parameters. Then, we valid this model by incorporating clinical data from the Amsterdam University Medical Centers. 

Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant at [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.cas.cn/) under the supervision of Associate Prof. Wei Zheng from June to August 2025. I received my B.Eng. degree in Energy Science from North China Electric Power University, where I worked with Prof. Xing Ju on thermal management of Li-ion battery.

I'm generally interested in leveraging computational methods to address challenges in biomedicine and sustainable energy. 
<!-- I completed my undergraduate degree in Energy and Power Engineering (Energy Storage Track), at [North China Electric Power University](https://www.ncepu.edu.cn/). -->

To be specific, I'm currently exploring topics like:
- Computational Science,
- Computational Biomedicine  
- AI for Medicine
- AI for Energy
