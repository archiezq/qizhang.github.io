I enjoy being alone, but I also love to hang out with friends. I cherish the time I spend with my friends and family.

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking and traveling. I love both being in the nature and exploring the city. I love rivers, lakes, oceans. Just every landscape with water. Watching the sunset on the beach is my favorite thing to do.

I am a huge fan of football. Manchester City is my home team.
