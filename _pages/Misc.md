## ENFP
I love to hang out with friends, but I also enjoy being alone. I cherish the time I spend with my friends and family.

## Traveling
In my spare time, I enjoy hiking and traveling. I love both being in the nature and exploring the city. I love rivers, lakes, oceans. Just every landscape with water. Watching the sunset on the beach is my favorite thing to do. I've been to many places in China, and I've also been to the Netherlands, France, and Italy.

## Football
I am a huge fan of football. Football is my favorite sport and I always play football in my leisure time. Manchester City is my home team !

## Music
I used to listen to a lot of J-pop and J-rock, but now I'm more into pop and rock. I also like some classical music.
